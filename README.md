# RevoU-Mini-Course

This project is a case study conducted during the Mini Course organized by RevoU.
In this case study, a dataset containing information about data science professions worldwide was provided.
The tasks assigned were as follows:

1. Study the dataset and list three points to be highlighted.
2. Explore and clean the dataset.
3. Create some visualizations.

The first thing I did was clean the dataset, which involved the following steps:

1. Checking and modifying data types.
2. Removing duplicate data.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Deleting irrelevant columns.
5. Renaming data in certain columns.
6. Checking for outliers.

After completing these steps, I proceeded to merge the dataset with an external dataset.
I used the ISO 3166 table for country codes and a table on the financial development of countries.
To merge the three tables, I utilized Google BigQuery.

Once the combined table was ready, I used Google Data Studio to create visualizations.
Finally, I saved the visualizations in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.
